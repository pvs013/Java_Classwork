//This problem will use the same data as the previous one. This time you are
//to complete the TemperatureDifferenceCalculator. It has two methods:
//
//public double maxDifference() - Calculates the maximum difference between
//any two consecutive day. If Jan 7 temperature is 5 degrees and
//Jan 8 is -10 degrees, the difference in the two temperatures is 15.
//The temperature changed 15 degrees between on day and the next. The difference
// is always the absolute value..
//
//public double minDifference() - Calculates the maximum difference between
//any two consecutive day
//
//For the draft, provide the method stubs (in this case the headers and
//a return value of 0)
